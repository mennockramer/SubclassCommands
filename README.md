# SubclassCommands
Executes user-specified commands based on their currently equipped Destiny 2 subclass.

Features:
- Config file: with entries for each element OR each subclass (e.g. Revenant/Behemoth/Shadebinder would have separate entries), where user-specifed commands go.
- Config file: how often the program checks the user's subclass in the API (default 10s)
- Config file: - Checking for Arc.bat or Arc.sh (and other elements, or per subclass, as above) in relative root, as an alternative to config-specified commands


Planned features:
- Option to only run while destiny2.exe is running.

Example use cases:
- Changing system RGB to match the subclass ([OpenRGB](https://openrgb.org/) has a CLI and wide compatability)
- Changing music? I don't know, I made it for the above.
