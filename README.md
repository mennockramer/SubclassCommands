# SubclassCommands
Executes user-specified commands based on their currently equipped Destiny 2 subclass.

Planned features:
- Config file, with entries for each element, where user-specifed commands go.
- Checking for Arc.bat or Arc.sh (and other elements) in relative root or user-specifed dir, in lieu of config specification
- Option to only run while destiny2.exe is running.

Example use cases:
- Changing system RGB to match the subclass ([OpenRGB](https://openrgb.org/) has a CLI and wide compatability)
- Changing music? I don't know, I made it for the above.
